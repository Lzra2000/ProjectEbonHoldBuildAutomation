-- Responsibility: correlate currently-active echoes with real combat
-- performance (DPS), using Details! damage meter's public API, if
-- installed. Off by default -- this is explicitly a rough, approximate
-- signal (echoes stack, execution/gear/fight-type vary run to run), not
-- a controlled measurement. Meant as a SUPPLEMENT to the theoretical
-- scoring model and Tuning Advisor's offer-distribution data, surfaced
-- through Export (AI) so an external AI has real performance context
-- too, not a replacement for either.
--
-- Everything that touches Details! is pcall-wrapped and feature-detected
-- -- it's a separate, large, independently-updated addon EbonBuilds does
-- not control, and its exact internals can change between versions. Only
-- the documented public API (Details:GetCurrentCombat, combat:GetActor,
-- actor.total, combat:GetCombatTime -- see Details' own API.lua) is used.

-- Quality bonus suggestions (experimental, report only -- no auto-apply
-- path exists for this yet, unlike per-echo weights).
--
-- Different question from per-echo weight suggestions: instead of "is
-- this ONE echo over/under-weighted relative to its peers," this asks
-- "is a whole QUALITY TIER systematically over/under-delivering relative
-- to its weight, in a way a single global Quality Bonus number might be
-- able to fix." Compares each tier's average DPS-per-weight-point
-- against the overall average across all weighted, tracked echoes.
--
-- Rationale for direction: a tier's current weight already reflects
-- whatever quality bonus is currently applied. If that tier is STILL
-- delivering above-average DPS per point of weight even after that
-- bonus, its true value looks under-represented -- suggest raising the
-- bonus further. If it's delivering below-average value despite the
-- bonus, the bonus is likely inflating that tier's weight beyond what
-- it earns -- suggest lowering it.
--
-- Deliberately conservative: needs more distinct echoes per tier than a
-- single-echo weight suggestion does (aggregating many echoes into one
-- number is a bigger generalization), and the suggested nudge is small,
-- since a bonus change affects every echo of that quality simultaneously
-- rather than just one.
