# Getting Started

<p class="ebb-lead">
Install EbonBuilds, create your first build, and turn on Autopilot in a few minutes.
</p>

!!! info "Download"
    Grab the latest **`EbonBuilds.zip`** from the
    [releases page](https://github.com/Lzra2000/ProjectEbonHoldBuildAutomation/releases/latest)
    before you start.

## Install

1. Download the latest `EbonBuilds.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/Lzra2000/ProjectEbonHoldBuildAutomation/releases/latest).
2. Extract it and put the `EbonBuilds` folder into `Interface/AddOns/`.
3. Restart the game or `/reload`.

Requires **ProjectEbonhold** or **ProjectEbonhold Enhanced**. Some features additionally use **Details!** if installed.

### Optional companion add-ons

| Add-on | Purpose | Install doc |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Auctionator** | Affix shopping / AH buyout hints with EbonBuilds | [`vendor/Auctionator/CREDITS.md`](https://github.com/Lzra2000/ProjectEbonHoldBuildAutomation/blob/main/vendor/Auctionator/CREDITS.md) |
| **Details!: Tiny Threat (PE)** | Threat meter Details! plugin for 3.3.5a | [Details!: Tiny Threat (PE)](details-tinythreat-pe.md) |

Extract optional zips (`Auctionator.zip`, `Details_TinyThreat.zip` when shipped) into `Interface/AddOns/` with folder names matching each `.toc`. Tiny Threat **requires Details!** in `Interface/AddOns/Details` — not included in EbonBuilds releases.

## First login

A one-time panel greets you after logging in. It asks the DPS-tracking consent question (tracking and community sharing are off until you say otherwise -- either answer is one checkbox in Settings if you change your mind), and offers What's new and the in-game guide. It shows once per addon version, then stays out of the way.

## Your first build

1. `/ebb` opens the main window. Click **+ New Build**.
2. On the **Build** tab set title, class, and spec. On **Priorities**, give the Echoes you care about rank values -- everything else can stay 0 to start.

3. **Autopilot** tab: pick an intent (Save charges / Balanced / Chase upgrades) rather than tuning thresholds by hand -- the intent presets are the dependable starting point.

4. Save, then enable Autopilot from the build overview. From here every echo choice screen is scored and acted on for you, and every decision lands in the **Logbook** with its reasoning.

## Let the data teach it

With Details! installed and tracking consented, the **Stats** views accumulate evidence across runs, and **Recommendations** proposes specific weight changes -- each with its confidence and a link to the exact decisions behind it. Nothing applies itself; you review and apply.
